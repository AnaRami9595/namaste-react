🟣What is JSX🦑
Is an html-like syntax language developed by Fb ingeneers, made to simplify
and make it more maintanable to creat UI components, as it closely resembls
the structure of the UI itself,


🟣Superpowers of JSX🦑

    - Declarative Syntax:
      JSX provvides a Declarative way to define the structure
      and content of UI components. This makes it easier to 
      visualize and understand the UI hierarchy.
    - Familiar Markup-like Syntax resembling HTML and XML
    - Embedding Expressions: JSX🦑allows embedding Javascript🟨
      expressions within curly braces `{}`. This enables dynamic
      rendering of content based on variables or other JS🟨 Elements.
      Also it sanitizes all the data that is inside the curly braces
      before being transpiled.
    - Components: JSX allowss you to define reusable UI 
      components asfunctions or classes.
    -Transpilation: JSX code needs to be transpiled into regular
      JS🟨 code before executed by Browsers🌍, this is typically
      done using tools like babel
    -Tree Reconciliation: this is a process that efficiently 
      updates the actual DOM📃 based on changes in JSX🦑 components.
    


🟣What is the role of the 'type' attribute in the 'script'
tag and what are the different kind of types?

    -the <script> tag is used to include scripting code, most commonly
     Javascript🟨, in a web page. The 'type' attribute in the <script>
     element. However it's important to note that the type attribute
     has becoe less significant in modern web development practices

    Examples of different 'types'

         ⏹️type="text/javascript"/ The "text" type can specify the
          language to indicate the scripting language, like 
          type="text/php" or ype="text/python", they can be ommited
          as the Default Value Of Text is javascript. 

         ⏹️type="module":  Indicates The File Type Is Module

         ⏹️type="text/ecmascript": Indicates the file is following
          Ecmascript standards.

        ⏹️type="application/javascript": s used to indicate that 
          the content within the <script> tag is JavaScript code. 
          It's important to note that this is a standard MIME type used 
          to specify JavaScript content.


🟣Explain 

            <TitleComponent></TitleComponent>:
            //The opening and closing tags are created to possibly
            include child components
            
            <TitleComponent/> 
            //This is a self closing component that is returning 
            some JSX🦑 code or a React Functional component, which
            is a JS🟨 Function that returns JSX🦑
            
            {TitleComponent}
            //This is a REACT⚛️ component passed as a dynamic
            value: JSX asumes it's a variable that returns JSX🦑
            code. However, since the Functional component is not
            being called like this '{TitleComponent()}' It won't
            be rendered in the Browser🌍
