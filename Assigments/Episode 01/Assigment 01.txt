🟡What Is Emmet?

Is a free add-on for your text editor. It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into
full pieces of code. 
For example, you can type an abbreviation like "div>ul>li*2"
and then use the Emmet expansion feature to automatically generate the following code:'

        🖥️<div>
            <ul>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

🟡Difference Between a Library and Framework?

    📔A library is a collection of pre-written functions, classes and 
    routines that you can use to perform specific tasks, like a tookbox
    of ready-made tools that you an use when needed. Features:

    - Control: You decide when and how to use the library's component
      in your app.

    - Flexibility: libraries are generally more flexible. You can choose
      to use specific parts of a library withoud being bound to it's 
      structure.

    - Example: jQuery is a Javascript🟨 library that siplifies DOM
    manipulation and provides utility function for web development.

    🪟A Framework is a more comprehensive package that provides a 
    structure and set of guidlines for building applications. It 
    dictates how your application should be organized, how components
    interact and often enforces specific design patterns

    - Inversion of control: the franework calls your ode, rather than
    you calling the framework.
    - Opinionated: Frameworks can be more opinionated, meaning they
      can prescribe certain practices and patters for consistency 
      across projects.
    - Example: Django is a web framework for Python that provides A
    complee structure for building web application

🟡What is CDN? Why do we use it?

      more efficient manner.

      It is used becouse it improves the speed, availability and 
      reliability of web content by distributing it across a network
      of servers. It can be injected directly to our code without 
      installing dependencies.

🟡Why is REACT⚛️ Known as REACT⚛️?

    - It is known as react because of its core concept and approach
      to handling user interface updates. The name "REACT⚛️" reflects

      specify that a script can be loaded from a different domain
      or origin while addering to security messures. 

      It helps in controlled cross-origin loading of scripts, 
      allowing web pages to fetch external scripts for 
      enhanced funtionality without compromising security.

🟡Difference Between REACT⚛️ and ReactDOM📃?

    - REACT⚛️ focuses on creating and managing UI components, handling
      state, props, and the overall component architecture

    - ReactDOM📃: Focuses on rendering React components into the 
      browser's DOM and managing updates when data changes

🟡Difference Between react.development.js and react.production.js files
via CDN?

    - react.development.js 🤓
      This version of the react library is intended for use during the
      development phase of your application. It is larger in size compared
      with the production version 


🟡What are async and defer? - check youtube video
Both are attributes that can be added to the <script> tag when including
external Javascript🟨 files in an HTML document. They affect how the 
browser how the browser downloads and executes the script while parsing
the  HTML

    browser will continue parsing the HTML document while the script 
    is being fetched in the background.

    - defer: When you include a script with the defer attribute, the 
    script is also fetched asynchronously, but it's executed after
    the HTML document has been fully passed
