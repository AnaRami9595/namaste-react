• What is Prop Drilling🏗️?
Prop drilling is a problem that originates
when you pass props from parent to child component🧩
ad infinitum. Also known  as prop passing or component
chaining. This happens when you have a REACT⚛️
hierarchy of REACT⚛️ components. This happens when
you have a hierarchyof React components and data needs
to be passed to a component🧩 that is deeply nested
in the hierarchy 

🔸 What is lifting the state up🔝?
It is a way of resolving the Prop Drilling🏗️ problem, instead of 
mantaining this shared state separately in each of the child
components that need it, you moe the state managment to a common
ancestor component🧩 that is above these child components🧩 in 
the component tree.

🔸 What are Context Provider and Context Consumer?
Are key components🧩 of the Context API in React, which provides
a way to pass datta, such as global state, down the component tree
whitout hainf explicitly pass props through every intermediate
component. These components🧩 are used for creating and consuming 
context within you REACT⚛️ application.

    •The Context Provider:
    Is responsible for creeating a context and providing the
    data (context value) to the child components🧩.

    •The Context Consumer:
    Context.Consumer is a component🧩 used within child
    components to access the data provided by the Context Provider
    It allows you to suscribe to the context and access the context
    value that the provider supplies

🔸 If you don't pass a value to the provider does it take the default value?
Yes? yes,
when you create a Context Provider🧧 using React.createContext and
you don't specfy a value, the Provider🧧 will use the default value
you provided when creating the context using createContext
