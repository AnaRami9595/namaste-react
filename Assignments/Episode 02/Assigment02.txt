🟣What is NPM🎁?
    It's a package manager, any package that you want to include in your 
    package can be managed  by np. Is a Fundamental tool in the Javascript🟨
    ecosystem, as it simplifies the process of including external code 
    Dependencies⛓️ 

🟣What is 'Parcel/Webpack'? Why do we need it?
    Are popu;ar build tools in the Javascript🟨 ecosystem, used to bundle
    and manage various assets like Javascript files, stylesheets, images
    and more. 

    We need them for:

    - Module Bundling
    - Asset Optmization🖼️: these tools optimize assets like images, fonts
      
    - Code Splitting: Parccel and webpack allow you to slit your application
      code into smaller chunks.
    - Importing Non-JS🟨 assets. 
    - HMR🔥: Both tools offer features like hot module replacement.
    - Traspilation
    - Automation

🟣What is .parcel-cache🕸️

    Is a folder that generates after installing Parcel📦 that makes caching, 
    so the subsequent changes in the build of the app are processed faster since
    the code is never build twice.

🟣What is NPX💣?
    Is a command-line tool that comes with Node.js and npm. It allows you to 
    run Node.js packages and exxecutables that are not globally installed in your
    system. It executes or runs packages, fetches the latest version each
    time you run a command and it has Local and global scope.

🟣What is the difference between Dependencies⛓️ vs devDependencies?

    - 'dependencies' are packages that your project requres to run succesfully
      in a production enviroment. They are essential for the functionality of
      your application.

    - 'devDependencies' are packages that are only required during development
      but aren't necessary for the application to run in its final deployed
      state.

🟣What is Tree Shaking🎄?

    - Is a term used in JS🟨 development, refers to the process of eliminating
      unused or dead code from your JS🟨 Bundles📚 during the Optmization🖼️
      phase of your Build process

🟣What is HMR🔥: 

    - Hot  module replacement is a development feature that allows devs to
      update a module's code without requiring a full page reload. 

🟣5 favourite super powers of Parcel📦:

    1. Diagnostics/Error Handling ✖️:
        The design of the errors using parcel is quite pretty and 
        also very exact describing the problem

    2. Code Splitting: Parcel📦 allows you to have it and optimizes the
       loading performance of web applications by breaking down the application
       codebase into smaller, more manageable chunks.

    3. HMR🔥: Hot module replacement is a feature that updates the code
      live, removing the need of reloading

    4.  Tree Shaking.

    5. cache🕸️

🟣What is the difference between package.json🎊 and package-lock.jason?

    - package.json🎊 Is a configuration file for NPM🎁.
    Includes the metadata of the project. And the ranging  of versions 
    of our Dependencies⛓️, meanwhile, 

    - package-lock.json🎊 captures
    the exact version our project and its dependencies are using in any 
    current time, It keeps track in all of them, that ensures consistency
    and predictability.

🟣What should not Modify package-lock.json🎊?

    - Modifying the package-lock.json🎊 file is not recommended as it can 
    lead to issues with dependency consistency and version conflicts. Changing
    it manually could lead to discrepancies between different development 
    enviroments and cause unexpected behavior. It might also result in conflicts
    between Dependencies⛓️ and their versions, This can lead to issues where
    certain parts of your application might work fine on one machine but
    fail on another due to inconsistent dependencies, therefore provoking
    collaboration issues and build and Deployment problems

🟣What is 'node_modules🔰"? Is it a good Idea to push that on Git🐈‍⬛?
    - "node_modules🔰" contains the actual DATA of our Dependencies⛓️ Is like a Data base.
      The file is so huge is kind of a meme

🟣What is the dist📂 folder?

    - The dist📂 folder typically stands for "distribution, and contains the 
      compiled and optimized version of your application code that is ready to be
      deployed to a production enviroment. Is not inherently part of REACT⚛️
      but rather a ommon convention used in many modern web dev projects.

 
🟣What is browserslist📂?

    - Is a configuration file and query tool used in modern web development
      tools to define which browsers and Browsers🌍 versions your project
      should support.
