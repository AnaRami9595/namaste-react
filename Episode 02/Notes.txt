----------Notes✏️--------

🔴---What is NPM?🎁---
It is NOT Node package management
It manages packages but it doesn't stand for that. It a standard repository for all packages.
Any package you need to include in your code, you can use npm.

    🤔How can you make your project use NPM?
    let's make our project use normaldo

        "npm init"
        entry point: (index.js)

🔴---What is package.json🎊---
It is a configuration for NPM🎁

    🤔 Why do we need it?
    Our project depends of a lot of packages, those packages our project is depending upon,  are called
    Dependencies⛓️. NPM🎁 manages that. NPM🎁 will take care of the version of that package. 

🔴---Let's start our Dependencies⛓️---
We are going to install the most important package in our project: A Bundler📚

    🤔What is a Bundler📚
    Our whole code needs to be bundled together, neat before send to production. A Bundler📚 helps you
    do that. Webpack, Parcel📦, are exemples of Bundlers📚. They package your app properly so it can be 
    sent to production. When you use the create-react-app command, it uses Webpack and Babel
    behind the scenes. In our project we will be using Parcel📦.

        💻To Install Parcel📦 in our project we use: "npm install -D parcel"

    🤔What does the "-D" mean??
    There are 2 types of Dependencies⛓️: Normal Dependency⛓️ and Dev 🤓 Dependency⛓️

        - A Dev🤓 Dependency⛓️ is regularly required when we are Building our app.
        We will use Parcel📦 as a Dev🤓 Dependency⛓️ to build our app in our development phase
        with the expression "npm install -D parcel" we are informing NPM🎁 That we will use
        this Bundler📚 as a Dev🤓 Dependency⛓️, therefore the "-D".
        We are fetching Parcel📦 from NPM🎁, which manages ALL the packages!!

        - A normal Dependencies⛓️ is used in production also. 
    
    Now that we installed Parcel📦, it shows on package.json🎊 as a Dependency⛓️: "  
    
        💻"devDependencies": {
        "parcel": "^2.9.3"
        }

    🤔What does the "^" mean??
    This symbol is known as Caret. It means that if a new minor version, like ""^2.9.4" for example comes out
    Parcel📦 will automatically upgrade to that minor version, however, it doesn't work for a major version
