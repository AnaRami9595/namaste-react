------Notes about the lesson✏️----

💡The order of File matters

💡The root needs to be defined. We can use the
ReactDOM.createRoot() method in order to create it

💡A react element is a JAVASCRIPT OBJECT. We create
a react element using React.createElement() It has three elements:
    1. Name of the tag
    2. An object to add attributes inside
    3. The children, they could be a normal React element. If they 
    have  multiple children, pass them as an array

💡Whenever we render the root element, the react code we place inside
it will replace everything that was there previously in the html.

💡React is a LIBRARY and not a Framework, that means that it can be used
in your  program in small chunks when is convenient, at the end of the day
it is only Javascript.
