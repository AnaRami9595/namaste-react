# Parcel📦

-Bundler📚
-Parcel just created a Dev Build for you
-It also created a local server for you
-HMR🔥 = Hot Module Replacement. This is what automatically refreshes our page. It does that because it
has a File wathing Algorithm that is written in C++, that keeps track of all our files
-Caching 🕸️ Faster Builds because of caching. It takes less and less time to build, because of the file
".parcel-cache" inside of the node_modules🔰, so that the next app Builds develop faster.
