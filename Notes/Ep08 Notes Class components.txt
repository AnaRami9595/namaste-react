class based componets is an older way to creating 
components, but they are still used sometimes and they are
very impotant to know because they are asked in the 
interviews

Let's mess with the About❔ page to experiment with 
class components, it will be a page in which we show
information about our team members, each team member
will have a card, so let's create a component🧩 to 
represent each card

🟠------Creating a 🎩Class Component🧩------------

This will be a Functional component🧩, but then we 
will use it as a 🎩Class based component🧩
in order to check how to adapt them. 

        //Functional component🧩:

        const User = () => {
        return (
        <div className="user-card">
            <h2>Name: Akshay</h2>
            <h3>Location: Dehradun</h3>
            <h4>Contact @akshaymarch7</h4>
            </div>
          )
        }
        export default User

🔹Now let's create a 🎩Class based component to see the 
difference. First of all, the convention in this case 
is to name our component🧩 with the SUfix "class"

        //🎩Class component🧩:

        class UserClass extends React.Component {
        render() {
            return (
                <div className="user-card">
                    <h2>Name: Akshay</h2>
                    <h3>Location: Dehradun</h3>
                    <h4>Contact @akshaymarch7</h4>
                </div>
                )
            }
        }

As you can see, a Class based component🧩 is just a
normal JS🟨 🎩Class that returns some JSX code.
It extends a React.Component and uses the render()
method that returns the piece of JSX. This will
be converted to HTML and displayed on the webpage

React.Component is a class given to us by react
and we extend it to host our component🧩
That means we will need to import it from REACT⚛️.
And export it just as a Functional component🧩.
Then we can use it in our About.js file

        //🖥️
        import User from "./User";
        import UserClass from "../UserClass";

        const About = () => {

            return (
                <div className="about">
                <h1>About</h1>
                <h2>This is Namaste React</h2>
                <User /> 👈 Functional Component🧩
                <UserClass /> 🎩Class Component🧩
                </div>
            );
        }

🟠-----Passing Props🥠 to a 🎩Class Component🧩----------

Let's Pass some Props🥠 to our Functional and 
🎩Class-based children components🧩 inside our
About.JS component🧩:

        🖥️const About = () => {
            return (
                <div className="about">
                    <h1>About</h1>
                    <h2>This is Namaste React</h2>
                👉<User name={"Ana (functional)"} />
                👉<UserClass name={"Ana (class)"} />
                </div>
            );
        }

Inside our 🛠️Functional Component🧩 we will receive
them like this: 

        🖥️ const User = ({ name }) => {👈
            return (
                <div className="user-card">
                 👉<h2>Name: {name}</h2>
                    <h3>Location: Dehradun</h3>
                    <h4>Contact @akshaymarch7</h4>
                </div>
              )
            }

But inside our 🎩Class component we will need to use
a fucking constructor function in order to access them
aund the "super" keyword.

We also need to use "this" in order to access the
prop we want to use.


        🖥️class UserClass extends React.Component {

           👉constructor(props) {
                👉super(props);
                console.log(props)
            }

            render() {
                return (
                    <div className="user-card">
                    👉<h2>Name: {this.props.name}</h2>
                        <h3>Location: Dehradun</h3>
                        <h4>Contact @akshaymarch7</h4>
                    </div>
                )
              }
            }


You can also destructure the Props🥠 to make our code
less ugly


        🖥️class UserClass extends React.Component {

           constructor(props) {
                super(props);
            }

            render() {
                const { name, location } = this.props

                return (
                    <div className="user-card">
                    ▶️<h2>Name: {name}</h2>
                     ▶️<h3>Location:{location}</h3>
                    </div>
                )
              }
            }

🟠-----Create state☁️ variables inside a 🎩Class Components🧩-------

Inside our 🛠️Functional component🧩 we will makee it like
this:

        🖥️ import { useState } from "react"

            const User = ({ name }) => {
                👉const [count] = useState(0)
                return (
                    <div className="user-card">
                       👉 <h1>{count}</h1>
                    </div>
                )
            }

            export default User;


Let's see how that will work inside our
🎩Class component🧩

    💡Things to consider:
        - Whenever you are loading a 🎩Class based
        component🧩 to display <Classcomponent/>
        you are creating an instance of that component
        or that CLASS. So the 🧑‍🏭Constructor function
        that is inside our 🎩Class component is the
        best way to make a state☁️ variable, since it
        will be able to be reused in all the instances
        of the Class❗

        Is different than a 🛠️Functional component🧩, 
        because in that case, you would be calling🛎️
        a Function


We will be using "this" to create a state variable.
Since this are ancient methods, hooks are not used
in this type of component🧩


        🖥️class UserClass extends React.Component {

            constructor(props) {
                super(props);

               👉 this.state = {
                    count: 0,
                };
            }

            render() {
                const { name, location } = this.props
                return (
                    <div className="user-card">
                        <h1>Count: 
                        👉{this.state.count}
                        </h1>
                    </div>

                    )
                }
            }

How do we write 2 state variable in a class based 
Component🧩?

            🖥️class UserClass extends React.Component {

            constructor(props) {
                super(props);

                this.state = {
                    👉count: 0,
                    👉count2:0
                };
            }

            render() {...}
            }

    //All our state☁️ variables need to be written
    inside this.state 

🟠-----Update state☁️ 🎩Class Components🧩-------

Can we update a state☁️ variable inside our 🎩Class component🧩 like this?

          {  🖥️  this.state = {
            count: 0,
                };
            }

            render() {
                const { name, location } = this.props
                const { count } = this.state
                return (
                    <div>
                        <button Onclick={() => { 
                            count++    }}> //❌NO, never update state variables directly 
                        Count increase
                         </button>
                    </di>
                )
            }

//This is an incorrect way to update state variables, you will need to another
method inside our 🎩Class component. which is  componentDidMount🎠

                🖥️  {...this.state = {
                            count: 0,
                                }
                                console.log("child constructor")
                            }
                            
                    componentDidMount{
                                 console.log(""child Component Did Mount"")
                    }

                    render() {
                                console.log("child render")

                                ...
                    }
            
        //PRINTS: "child constructor", "child render", ""child Component Did Mount""🤔

So what happens is when the component🧩 is loaded. 
The render🖌️ method is called, and after that, the componentDidMount🎠
method is executed. This is  the Life cycle🦁 of the REACT⚛️ component🧩

So once the component🧩 is mounted successfully then 
componentDidMount()🎠 will be called. After the child component is mounted
In this case UserClass.JS🟨 then the parent Component, About.JS🟨
will be mounted.

    💡Very important Use case!!!
    componentDidMount()🎠 is frequently used to make API calls. 
    Is in the same way we use useEffect💥: to first render our
    component, then make an API call, and once our component🧩
    is mounted, then render the rest of the component🧩 with
    the data of the API

Let's make our parent component🧩 a 🎩Class based component🧩 too:


                class About extends Component {

                    constructor(props) {
                        super(props);
                        console.log("Parent constructor")
                    }

                    componentDidMount() {
                        console.log("Parent Component did Mount")
                    }

                    render() {
                        console.log("Parent render")
                    }
                }

        //Order of Rendering: 
        Parent constructor
        About.js:18 Parent render
        UserClass.js:12 child constructor
        UserClass.js:22 child render
        UserClass.js:16 child Component Did Mount
        About.js:14 Parent Component did Mount

Making another instance of the class:

                //🖥️adding another instance of UserClass:

                     return (<div className="about">
                    👉<UserClass name={"Ana (class)"}
                        location={"Dehradun (class)"} />

                    👉<UserClass name={"Elon Musk (class)"}
                        location={"Hell (class)"} />
                     </div>)


Order of render🖌️ in the console: 

//Render🖌️ phase
//it's fast, uses diff, calculates differences
//reconciliation 

About.js:    Parent constructor
About.js:18  Parent render
UserClass.js:12 Ana (class) child constructor
UserClass.js:22 Ana (class) child render
UserClass.js:12 Elon Musk (class) child constructor
UserClass.js:22 Elon Musk (class) child render

//Commit phase🤝
//it is costly, takes time
//Over here the DOM d📄 manipulation begins:
//It does it in a single Batch 

UserClass.js:16 Ana (class) child Component Did Mount
UserClass.js:16 Elon Musk (class) child Component Did Mount
About.js:14 Parent Component did Mount


🟠-----Making an API CALL inside 🎩Class Components🧩-------

API CALLS are made using the method componentDidMount()🎠
The same way we use useEffect💥 inside a Functional Component.

We are going to get user information from Github API's to make
our team page.
We can make an API call by making "componentDidMount🎠" an async
function:

                //🖥️ 
                async componentDidMount() {
                const data = await fetch(
                    "https://api.github.com/users/akshaymarch7")
                const json = await data.json();
                console.log(json)
                }

                //The console logs the json for our user.

🟠-----Updating a state☁️ variable inside 🎩Class Components🧩-------
🤔But how do we update it? Using a State variable. First let's create
a Dummy state☁️ variable so we can update it later: 

                //🖥️
                class UserClass extends React.Component {

                constructor(props) {
                    super(props);

                    this.state = {
                        userInfo: {
                            name: "Dummy",
                            location: "Default"
                            ...
                     ...}
                    }
                  }
                }

            🦁LIFE CYCLE of State☁️ VARIABLES

    1️⃣---MOUNTING Cycle--

        1. Constructor (Dummy🧑‍🦼).
            REACT⚛️ calls our 🧑‍🏭Constructor function 
            that has our state☁️ variable. 

        2. Render (Dummy🧑‍🦼).
            REACT⚛️ renders the Dummy🧑‍🦼 data inside our
            component🧩. We can also display a Shimmer🌠
            component so we have a friendlier UX

        3. componentDidMount()🎠
            <API Call>
            It makes the API call using our async 
            componentDidMount🎠method. 

            In this step, the state☁️ variable is updated
            thankst to this.setState() method

    2️⃣---UPDATE Cycle-- 

        1. Render (API Data)
            Our fetched data now gets rendered, inside the 
            HTML
            It calls componentDidUpdate() method!!


    2️⃣---UNMOUNTING Cycle-- 
        It is when our component disappears from the UI, That is,
        when we go to another page or component🧩.

        It calls the componentWillUnmount()💀 method.

                //🖥️When we go to About.js -> Contact.js
                Our console will log "component will unmount"

                componentWillUnmount() {
                console.log("component will unmount")

                 }🖥️


    💡Never compare 🦁LIFE CYCLE of a 🎩Class component🧩 with
    a functional component. 
    componentDidMount🎠 and useEffect💥 are completely different
    and are making different stuff behind the scenes, is not 
    a substitute
